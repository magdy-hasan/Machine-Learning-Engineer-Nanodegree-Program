## Project Overview
Trying to predict age from face image  
working on the [imdb dataset faces only](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/)  

1. first use pre_data.ipynb to load data and clean it

2. use create_train_files.ipynb to create training files to fit the model on, as the dataset is too big to fit on memory

3. use new_train-Copy4.ipynb for trainning
